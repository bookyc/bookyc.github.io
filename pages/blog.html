                Hello friends, as this is the first blog post, as expected, it's hard to 
                have a decent structure to my thoughts at the moment. 
                <br><br><br>
                Currently, the only thing i'm consistently working on is this website of mine, but, unfortunately a website 
                isn't a good porfolio project for a computer science major; 
                it's really only to show off my projects (and my hobbies) in one organized space. 
                <br><br>
                Even though its the only thing i've got goin, I still rarely get the motivation to add stuff to it. 
                Especially seeing as how there isn't anything to add to it content wise, which is why i'm starting to organize my 
                plans and thought processes here. I could get into my struggles making these simple buttons/features but thats not the 
                main purpose of today's post.
                <br><br><br>
                Anyway, as the title states, I have come up with a couple project ideas to kickstart my (empty) porfolio. 
                I've been thinking of how to eventually build my way up to a machine learning algorithm to play a game but there 
                has always been a major roadblock to this: finding a game I can run the simulations on without ruining other peoples' 
                experiences or making hundreds of new accounts to run them off of.
                <br><br>
                The game I wanted to run simulations on was tetris, which seems pretty straightforward to build, right? As it seems like 
                something that would be fun to try and implement high level tetris tactics into a machine learning algorithm (even though i've 
                never made one before).
                <br><br>
                Which brings me to my next idea, which is also a game. Since tetris isn't the most intricate game to program, 
                I wanted to create something that implements proper physics and other mechanics that I can't think of off the top of my head. 
                Something similar to peggle, the old popcap game from when I was a wee lad. 
                <br><br>
                I'd be able to implement the collision mechanics, physics math (which unity will probably handle for me), score, and abilities 
                for all the different characters. Hell, maybe I can turn it into one of those bad instagram ad games where the ball splits 
                into like, a million more balls lol. 
                <br><br><br>
                I'll probably update this blog once I get either the tetris or the ball game (this is the new name for the project) with 
                my new complaints/thoughts. By then, the blog site should be able to swap between current/old blogs either by redirecting to a new html, 
                or by hiding/showing the text, idk i'll experiment. Or who knows, maybe i'll get distracted by something else and totally forget 
                about this as the new school semester starts. 
                <br><br>
                I should really enter a hackathon or something...
